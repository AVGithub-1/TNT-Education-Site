# Lesson 1: Introduction to Neurotechnology

## Overview
In this lesson, we will explore the basic principles of neurotechnology, its applications, and its potential impact on society.

### Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the definition and scope of neurotechnology.
- Identify key applications of neurotechnology.
- Discuss the ethical considerations surrounding neurotechnology.

## What is Neurotechnology?
Neurotechnology refers to the set of tools and devices that interact directly with the nervous system to monitor or modulate neural activity.

### Key Points
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs):** Devices that allow direct communication between the brain and external devices.
- **Neuroprosthetics:** Assistive devices that replace or enhance the function of damaged neural systems.

## Applications of Neurotechnology
Neurotechnology is being used in:
- **Medical Fields**: E.g., treating neurological disorders such as Parkinsonâ€™s or epilepsy.
- **Non-Medical Fields**: E.g., enhancing cognitive abilities or controlling external devices through thought.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy Concerns:** What happens with the data collected from the brain?
- **Consent and Autonomy:** Can individuals fully understand the implications of neurotechnology?

## Quiz
1. What is neurotechnology?
2. Name two applications of neurotechnology.
3. Discuss one ethical concern related to neurotechnology.

## Assignment
Write a 500-word essay on the potential societal impact of neurotechnology. Be sure to discuss both positive and negative aspects.

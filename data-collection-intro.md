# Data Collection Intro

## What is Data Collection?

Data collection is the process of interacting with participants and recording neural signal data from them, which can then be analyzed and used to accomplish a certain task (control a BCI, train a machine learning model, etc.).

This is one of the most important processes in Neurotechnology since it's an essential step where you collect the data that controls your Brain-Computer Interface; If your data is poor quality, nothing else in the BCI will work.

## How is Data Collected?

There are many different techniques used to collect data about the brain and its signals: MRI, fMRI, PET, EEG, EMG, EKG, MEG, etc.

However, these vary drastically in terms of many important features, including:

- spatial resolution: the smallest/biggest detectable feature it can capture, like single cells, multiple cells, entire brain regions, etc.
- temporal resolution: the accuracy of a measurement over time, or how quickly it can detect changes
- Size: some techniques require big machines, others require small headsets
- Cost: the devices for some techniques are incredibly expensive but others can be fairly cheap, or even be made yourself.
- Ease of use: Some of these techniques require a lot of training, takes a while to set up recording sessions, etc. while others don't require as much

In our club, we use EEG and EMG, since these are standard, effective techniques that are common in neuroscience research, and the recording devices used for them are on the cheaper and easy-to-use end of the spectrum.

## What to Expect in the Data Collection Lessons?

As the year progresses, lessons will be updated and new lessons will be added based on the needs and interests of the club and project members. For now, you can expect:

- A high-level guide to the data collection pipeline and process
- detailed tutorials on collecting EEG and EMG data
- Links to relevant lessons from other sections (ex: recording software guide in Software, EEG Headset lesson from Hardware)
- Ways to validate the data you collect and ensure it's clean and accurate data, and re-record if needed
